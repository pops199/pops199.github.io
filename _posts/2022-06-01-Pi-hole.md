One-Step Automated Install¶
Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install Pi-hole using the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

Info

Piping to bash is a controversial topic, as it prevents you from reading code that is about to run on your system.

If you would prefer to review the code before installation, we provide these alternative installation methods.

Alternative 1: Clone our repository and run¶

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole
cd "Pi-hole/automated install/"
sudo bash basic-install.sh
Alternative 2: Manually download the installer and run¶

wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
sudo bash basic-install.sh
