# Using Docker:

When setting up Pi-hole in a Docker container, you’ll first need to create a Docker volume to store the Pi-hole application and DNS configuration.

Open a terminal, then run the below commands for Docker to create two volumes (volume create) named *pihole_app* and *dns_config*. You can also change the names according to your preference.

```bash
sudo docker volume create pihole_app
sudo docker volume create dns_config
```

Next, verify that the Docker volumes have been created successfully by running the following command which lists all Docker volumes available on your machine.

```bash
docker volume ls
```

Below, you see two newly created volumes named *pihole_app* and *dns_config*.

## Running Pi-hole in Docker Container with Environment Variables

Now that you have two persistent volumes available, you are ready to run a Docker container using Pi-hole’s base Docker image. But first, you’ll need to note your local IP address.

Run the below command to get your local IP address. Your local IP address is necessary to run the single Docker command properly.

```bash
ifconfig
```
> **NOTE: If ifconfig is not installed, you first need to install net-tools with  the following command:**
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt install net-tools
> ```


Once you've got your IP address, run the command below to pull the *pihole/pihole* base image from Docker hub. Replace the values accordingly using the table below as your reference. The table below explains each flag of the command’s purpose.

```bash
docker run --name=pihole -e TZ=Africa/Johannesburg -e WEBPASSWORD=password -e SERVERIP=YourIPAddressHere -v pihole_app:/etc/pihole -v dns_config:/etc/dnsmasq.d -p 81:80 -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp --restart=unless-stopped pihole/pihole
```

## Pi-hole Docker Command Flags:

> ### Command Flags  Definition 
>
> `--name=pihole` - Names a Docker container as pihole. There will be an error if a container with the same name already exists on your machine
>
> `-e TZ=Asia/Manila` - Environment variable for time zone. Asia/Manila was used for this tutorial, but you can input anything that has the same format listed in on a GitHub gist.
>
> `-e WEBPASSWORD=password` - Sets a password for the Pi-hole interface.
>
> `-e SERVERIP=YourIPAddressHere` - Set your IP address for the Docker container. You will use this again later for making Pi-hole work.
>
> `-v pihole_app:/etc/pihole` - Mounts the volume pihole_app and use subdirectory /etc/pihole for storing the Pi-hole files
>
> `-v dns_config:/etc/dnsmasq.d` - Mounts the volume dns_config and use subdirectory /etc/dnsmasq.d for storing DNS configurations as required.
>
> `-p 81:80 -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp` - Maps the ports of host machine to the ports of the Docker container (port 81 in host machine maps to port 80 of Docker container)
>
> `—restart=unless-stopped` - Sets a restart policy so the Docker container always restarts unless it is manually stopped by the user.
>
> `pihole/pihole` - Tells the docker run command to use the official pihole/pihole base image from Docker hub.

One-Step Automated Install¶
Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install Pi-hole using the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

## Info

Piping to bash is a controversial topic, as it prevents you from reading code that is about to run on your system.

If you would prefer to review the code before installation, we provide these alternative installation methods.

### Option 1: Clone our repository and run

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole
```
```bash
cd "Pi-hole/automated install/"
```
```bash
sudo bash basic-install.sh
```

### Option 2: Manually download the installer and run

```bash
wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
```
```bash
sudo bash basic-install.sh
```
