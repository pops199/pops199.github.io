You need to edit the fstab file on your system to auto mount an external drive on boot.

1 - Run the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
2 - Edit the file and add the following line at the bottom of the file:

```
//location/of/drive /media/mnt cifs username=user,password=password,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
```
3 - Run the mount command to mount the directories specified:
```bash
sudo mount -a
```

If Smb is not installed, it can be installed by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install smbclient
```
