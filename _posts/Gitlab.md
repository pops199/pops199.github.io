# Gitlab / Github

To clone a repository to your local machine you need to run the following code:

*Remember that you need to be in the directory you want to clone it to.*
```bash
git clone https://pops199.github.io
```
*Or if you want to clone it to a specific folder you can add the path at the end*
```bash
git clone https://pops199.github.io /path/you/want/to/save/to
```

Once you are done editing the files, you need to save, commit and push the files back to github.
