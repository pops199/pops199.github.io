To clone a repository to your local machine you need to run the following code:

*Remember that you need to be in the directory you want to clone it to.*
```bash
git clone https://pops199.github.io
```
*Or if you want to clone it to a specific folder you can add the path at the end*
```bash
git clone https://pops199.github.io /path/you/want/to/save/to
```

Once you are done editing the files, you need to save, commit and push the files back to github.

### 1. Save the file in the editor you are using
### 2. Check the status of your changes
```bash
git status
```
The output should look something like this:
```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   _config.yml
	deleted:    _posts/Gitlab.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	_posts/2022-05-31-Gitlab.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
### 3. Add the changes to your repo *(Again be sure to be in the directory of your repo)*
```bash
git add .
```
### 4. Commit the changes and add a comment
```bash
git commit -m "Your comment about changes made"
```
### 5. Finally push the files to your github repo
```bash
git push
```

The files will now be visible and changes on your github website.

## Pushing files from more than one computer

If you pushed files to your repo and now needs to push from a different computer again, the files first needs to be merged by running:
```bash
git config pull.rebase false
```
then run:
```bash
git pull
```

Now the files should be synced and merged, now you can push again to the same repo from the computer.
